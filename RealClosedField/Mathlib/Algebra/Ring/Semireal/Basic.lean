# Semireal rings

A semireal ring is a commutative ring (with unit) in which `-1` is *not* a sum of squares.

For instance, linearly ordered rings are semireal, because sums of squares are positive and `-1` is
not.

## Main declaration

- `IsSemireal`: the predicate asserting that a commutative ring `R` is semireal.

A semireal ring is a commutative ring (with unit) in which `-1` is *not* a sum of
squares. We define the class `IsSemireal R` for all structures equipped with
a multiplication, an addition, a multiplicative unit and an additive unit.
